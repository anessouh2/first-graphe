      "text": "After Swift Turnaround for New Deployment, USS Truxton Returns to the Pier USS Truxton under way (USN file image) Published Feb 5, 2026 11:02 PM by The Maritime Executive On February 3, the destroyer USS Truxton conducted a fast turnaround from Naval Station Norfolk in order to redeploy to an unknown destination. The next day, she returned to the pier because of an equipment issue, delaying her departure. Last year, Truxton spent seven months on deployment in the Middle East. She returned to Norfolk in October for maintenance, training and shore leave. On February 3, after about three months in port, she departed again, with speculation pointing to the Caribbean or the Mideast, where a military buildup is under way amidst tensions with Iran. Three months is a comparatively short time for a destroyer to spend in port between deployments: For repairs and upkeep, U.S. Navy destroyers typically get months of pierside maintenance or a drydocking, followed by six months or more in homeport for training and certification. \"The Navy's kind of asked more for us and our families,\" Truxton CO Cmdr. James Koffi told local WHRO about the swift deployment. \"My crew has done impeccably well during the short turnaround. So I really don't focus on the number of days. . . . I'm very confident of our abilities to execute.\" Truxton sailed from Norfolk at about 1000 hours on Tuesday, headed for the York River naval weapons station to take on stores. A harbor webcam spotted her returning to Norfolk on February 4, and USNI confirmed her return to the pier for maintenance purposes on February 5.

Subscribe Now A spokesperson for U.S. Second Fleet told USNI that Truxton had to address an \"emergent equipment repair,\" and the extra time at Norfolk would allow the crew to ensure \"maximum operational readiness.\" Rapid deployment turnarounds are not unheard-of, but when done, they are often a cause for complaint among the crew - especially if the previous deployment was a long one. Destroyer USS The Sullivans deployed five times in the three years ending 2024, though some of her voyages were comparatively brief.",

On February 2, French Navy forces intercepted a small tanker at an unspecified location off French Polynesia, an archipelago of 120-plus islands and atolls. The responders pursued the suspect vessel with RIB boats and conducted a boarding. Upon inspection, they found 4.2 tonnes of cocaine in 174 separate bales. According to the authorities, the drugs were likely destined for South Africa - not a leading consumer market. This voyage would have taken the vessel past Australia, where demand is thriving and prices are high. The response team destroyed the cocaine at sea, but did not carry out any arrests. The suspects were released and allowed to continue their voyage; according to AFP, local prosecutors did not wish to burden the court system with a smuggling case that did not directly involve French Polynesia, either as the point of origin or as the destination. ????Polynésie française | Importante saisie de cocaïne en haute mer ? ????

The Australian Federal Police are actively supporting these law-enforcement efforts in French Polynesia, and are working with French authorities to track down the shoreside elements of the smuggling group within Australia.

The milestone was announced at about the same time as the latest strike in the Pentagon's parallel, lethal-force campaign against the same drug-boat traffic. In August, the Coast Guard doubled down on its counternarcotics operation in the Eastern Pacific with a new focused enforcement effort, dubbed Operation Pacific Viper. The region is home to a thriving cocaine trade, carried by go-fast boats and semisubmersibles on short-haul routes from South America to Central America. From origin ports in Colombia and Ecuador, these boats take to the high seas and deliver their valuable cargoes to Honduras, Guatemala and other small Central American nations, sometimes using routes far offshore. From there, the drugs are smuggled overland - either northward to the U.S. land border with Mexico, or to regional seaports for covert shipment to Europe (the destination for the majority of the total volume). Cocaine is so abundant on these smuggling routes that the Coast Guard's seizures account for 80 percent of all U.S.-bound drugs - far more than any other agency is able to capture. \"Each Coast Guard drug seizure far from our borders prevents deadly drugs from reaching our communities and disrupts the profit that fuels narco-terrorists,\" said Commandant Adm. Kevin Lunday in a statement. \"The success of Operation Pacific Viper proves that we own the sea, and the proficiency, vigilance, and heart of our crews is our greatest strength.\" The latest busts included 13,000 pounds of cocaine captured by USCGC Seneca (a medium-endurance cutter built in 1982) and another 13,000 pounds by USCGC Robert Ward (a 350-ton Sentinel-class patrol boat). These large seizures add on to previous successes: the service set a new record in mid-November when USCGC Stone offloaded nearly 50,000 pounds in one delivery at Port Everglades, entirely the product of her crew's efforts.

      "text": "NGO Shipbreaking Platform Reports on 2025 and Calls for More Regulation NGO Shipbreaking Platform raises concerns ahead of the anticipated surge is ships being sold for dismantling Published Feb 5, 2026 9:17 PM by The Maritime Executive The NGO Shipbreaking Platform compiled a report on the ships sold for dismantling in 2025 while calling for continued efforts to improve the industry’s adherence to safety and environmental regulations. The group highlights that despite the Hong Kong Convention coming into effect at mid-year, there was little improvement in the performance of the shipbreakers. The listing shows a total of 321 vessels were dismantled in 2025. The overall number remains low as most segments of commercial shipping have extended the life of vessels, in part due to demand and waiting for environmental regulations to be solidified. NGO Shipbreaking expressed concern that, as the backlog of older ships starts to move to dismantling, the safety and environmental issues will be further exacerbated unless steps are taken now. It highlights that 85 percent of the ships sold for dismantling in 2025 went to South Asia. A total of 214 ships, with Bangladesh and India remaining as the leading destinations, along with Pakistan. More than 6 million gross tons were sent to the three countries. By comparison, 49 ships went to Turkey (under 700,000 GT), 44 ships in other parts of the world, and only 14 ships were dismantled in the EU. The global total in 2025 was just 321 ships, according to NGO Shipbreaking Platform. This is down from over 400 ships in each of the three prior years, and a peak of over 1,000 ships per year a decade ago. Bangladesh, the group highlights, has already approved 17 yards under the Hong Kong Convention. The NGO, however, highlights that despite more than 100 shipbreaking plots in India around Alang, none so far have been authorized under the convention. The convention seeks to improve the safety and environmental record of the industry by requiring specific ship recycling plans that consider the listing of hazardous materials that each ship is required to maintain. The yards also need to have safety and environmental plans. The convention applies to all ships over 500 GT sold by companies in any of the states having adopted the convention. NGO Shipbreaking reports the safety concerns continued in 2025, with a total of 11 workers losing their lives. Despite lax and opaque reporting, it believes that another 62 workers were injured at the yards in South Asia. Among the worst incidents reported in 2025, NGO Shipbreaking highlights the explosion on an oil tanker being dismantled in Bangladesh. Eight workers were injured in the explosion. The group highlights that there are discussions at the International Maritime Organization about enhancing the requirements of the convention and updating the standards, which were drafted more than a decade ago. IMO states first adopted the Hong Kong Convention in 2009, but it took till 2023 to reach the threshold for it to go into force in 2025. Ingvild Jenssen, Executive Director and Founder of NGO Shipbreaking Platform, emphasizes that the IMO must take action to phase out the beaching method for dismantling ships. “At the same time, better enforcement of the Basel Convention’s restrictions on hazardous waste trade need to be ensured through measures that effectively hold the shipping industry accountable. This entails shifting responsibility to the states that actually have control over the owners of assets intended for disposal,” said Jenssen. As the backlog of old ships breaks, the group points to the potential of hundreds of tankers being sold for dismantling, including ships from the so-called shadow fleet. It is concerned that these ships, which skirt regulations, will continue to do so with the owners seeking cash, crypto, and foreign currency deals to avoid sanctions. NGO Shipbreaking calculates that China is one of the key sources of ships heading to South Asian shipbreakers. Last year, it reports China sent 21 vessels, with most going to Bangladesh. South Korea (19 ships) and the UAE (17 ships), it says, were also sending ships to the South Asia yards. The group points out that this is despite the UAE Ship Recycling Regulation, which went into force in June 2025, which prohibits ships from leaving the UAE territorial waters for beach scrapping and landing yards.

NGO Shipbreaking notes that Turkey is one of the few non-EU destinations that can receive WEU-flagged end-of-life-vessels, but notes that its sector is coming under mounting scrutiny. It notes the growing opposition to the industry at Allaga and the growing pressure for the EU to withdraw approvals for the yards. Next year marks 20",

      "text": "China Moves to Penalize Panama for Court Ruling Against Hutchison's Ports Both the U.S. and China are applying heavy pressure to Panama in a bid for influence on a strategic maritime choke point (file image) Published Feb 5, 2026 8:13 PM by The Maritime Executive The Chinese government has reportedly forced a pause on infrastructure deals in Panama in retaliation for a Panamanian court's decision to suspend CK Hutchison's seaport operations contracts, according to Bloomberg. The development comes as Hong Kong-based Hutchison launches an arbitration process against Panama over the cancelation. Last week, the Panama Supreme Court ruled that contracts that allowed Hutchison to operate two container ports near the Panama Canal were \"unconstitutional.\" Hutchison - which has been trying to sell the operating rights for the two ports as part of a giant package deal for its global portfolio - disputes this finding, and has accused Panamanian authorities of disregarding its communications during the trial. For now, the terminals remain in the firm's operational control, it says. In response to the ruling, Hutchison has initiated arbitration proceedings in Hong Kong against the Panamanian government. The arbitration process could take years; if successful, it would likely result in a compensation payment, legal analysts say. The Panamanian court ruling against Hutchison followed nearly a year of pressure from the Trump administration over alleged Chinese influence in the Panama canal zone. The White House, without evidence, has accused China of \"running\" the canal; it initially threatened to take action to \"take back\" the canal from Panamanian control. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently told Panama that China's presence near the canal \"is unacceptable,\" and could prompt the U.S. to take unspecified measures to \"protect its rights under the treaty\" that transferred control from the U.S. to Panama in 1999. Hutchison's giant plan for a $23 billion port portfolio sale would have handed its two Panama port leases to an American company, BlackRock, a favorable development for U.S. interests. Everything else would be sold to Terminal Investment Limited (TIL), the ports division of the Aponte family's shipping empire - if the deal can be concluded. Against this backdrop of U.S. pressure, the government of China has accused Panama's supreme court of giving in to \"hegemonic powers\" by ruling against Hutchison. In a statement, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs office - responsible for the jurisdiction where Hutchison is headquartered - called the ruling \"utterly ridiculous,\" and threatened \"a heavy price both politically and economically\" for Panama if it is not reversed.

Chinese state companies have been instructed to pause all talks over new infrastructure projects in Panama - a serious threat, given China's prominent role in Panama's construction sector. Chinese customs officials are also reportedly applying additional scrutiny to Panama's agricultural exports. Possible further actions could include rerouting cargo to other seaports, depriving Panama of revenue. So far, Panama's leaders have been unequivocal in resisting Chinese pressure. President Jose Raul Mulino said Wednesday that Panama's government respects the independence of the judiciary, and as a \"country of laws,\" it has no interest in overriding the court system.",

      "text": "Maersk Predicts Difficult Times for Industry After a Strong Performance Maersk expects overcapacity and continuing pressure of freight rates for the container business Published Feb 5, 2026 7:47 PM by The Maritime Executive Maersk, long considered a bellwether of the container shipping industry and broader global economy, presented a bleak near-term outlook as it reported 2025 financial results. The company pointed to the continued uncertainties in global trade as well as a growing overcapacity in container shipping, which it foresees contributing to further declines in freight rates and its earnings outlook. While posting a strong overall performance in 2025, which included nearly five percent volume growth for ocean shipping and terminals that achieved record volumes, revenues, and EBIT, the company reported continued declines in freight rates, which contributed to sharply lower earnings. Average freight rates were down more than 20 percent year-over-year and approximately eight percent in sequential quarters in the fourth quarter, which the company attributed to driving its shipping segment to an earnings loss (EBIT) of $153 million in the quarter. The company overall reported $13.3 billion in revenues with earnings (EBIT) of just $100 million. (EBITDA $1.8 billion). The company reached the top of its forecast for 2025, in part as the return to Red Sea routes was delayed and continued to drive utilization. It reported full-year revenues of $54 billion with earnings on an EBIT basis of $3.5 billion (EBITDA $9.5 billion). CEO Vincent Clerc, however, presented a bleak picture to investors during the company’s conference call. He said they expected that global container volume would grow between two and four percent this year, but said they expected “container shipping rates to develop adversely.” One key concern is overcapacity, both from the new ships entering the market and the six-year deferral at scrapping older ships. He forecast an overcapacity of between four and eight percent in 2026, saying “you will need to see some scrapping” for the overcapacity to be reduced. The overcapacity, he said, could be further exacerbated if the return to Red Sea routes comes faster than anticipated and in turn further pressure rates. He still expects a gradual return to the routes through the Suez and Red Sea and pointed out that it would make slower steaming possible and contribute to lower costs. Maersk’s forecast for 2026 presented a worst-case scenario, which could see a financial loss of $1.5 billion (EBIT) and a best-case scenario of a profit of $1.5 billion. Cash flow could also be negative, and to reduce depreciation, the company made a change in the estimated useful lives of vessels from 20 to 25 years, effective January 1, 2026.

For 2026, he said Maersk would cut around 15 percent (1,000 positions) from a global corporate workforce of 6,000 and a total workforce of more than 100,000. This follows broader reductions that started in 2023. The forecast is that Maersk will reduce corporate expenses by $180 million with these latest headcount reductions. The company is also reorganizing its logistics segment into groups focused on landside, forwarding, and solutions. To demonstrate faith and support the stock price, the company also initiated a new share buy-back program. The company’s shares were able to claw back some of their early losses, but still closed the day down four percent.",

Synerget has agreed to buy 10 of the 12-passenger Viceroy models that Regent has designed for coastwise routes, with first deliveries slated for 2029. Possible early applications could be big port cities, like Rio de Janiero. The appeal factors, the operator says, include the ability to skip airports altogether and to operate on purely battery-electric power. \"Regent's Seaglider represents a compelling new category of mobility,\" said Fabio Rebello, CEO, Synerjet. \"By combining aircraft-like speed with dock-to-dock convenience and zero-emission operations, Seagliders allow us to expand our service offering and unlock new regional routes that were previously impractical or underserved.\" In addition to the convenience of pierside boarding, Regent offers some potential cost-saving advantages over business jets, too: no fuel, no airport fees, and no aircraft-pilot training and licensing requirements. As it is legally a vessel under navigation rules (WIG craft have their own COLREGS section), it can be operated by a mariner, with some additional training.

      "text": "Captain of Solong Gets Six Years as Court Cites “Complacency and Arrogance\" The Solong burned for days with the prosecution arguing the collision was avoidable, endangered both crews, and killing the one seafarer Published Feb 5, 2026 5:52 PM by The Maritime Executive A judge at the UK’s “Old Bailey” court in London sentenced the former master of the Solong containership to six years in jail for causing the death of a seafarer in the fiery 2025 allision with the tanker Stena Immaculate. A jury on Monday had found Vladimir Motin, age 59 of Russia, guilty of gross negligent manslaughter. Motin had been on watch and the sole member of the crew on the bridge on March 10, 2025, when the containership hit the anchored tanker Stena Immaculate off the coast of England. One crewmember, Mark Angelo Pernia, who was working at the bow of the containership, was never found and presumed to have died from the impact, explosion, and fire that engulfed the two ships. The other 13 crewmembers from the containership and the 23 on the tankers were rescued. The containership was a total loss, while Stena sold the badly damaged tanker and said the new owner intended to repair the ship. Justice Andrew Barker said during the sentencing on February 5 that Motin’s version of events was “extremely implausible.” He called the allision with the tanker and the death of the seafarer “wholly avoidable.” The master of the Solong, Vladimir Motin, was sentenced to six years in jail (Crown Prosecution Service) During the sentencing hearing, the judge said that he believed the captain had fallen victim to his “complacency and arrogance.” Testimony during the trial had shown that the Solong was functioning properly and that the Stena Immaculate was visible for more than 30 minutes on radar. Motin, the court was told, had waited until the vessels were one nautical mile apart before attempting to turn the containership. He did not attempt to slow the containership, undertake a crash stop, or sound any alarms before hitting the Stena Immaculate amidships. “You were a serious accident waiting to happen,” said Justice Barker, addressing Motin. The court had heard that Motin had turned off the system that required someone on the bridge to press a button every 30 minutes to confirm that the bridge was manned and someone was alert, although the captain asserted that he had not fallen asleep that morning or left the bridge after his watch began. He said a lookout was not required before there was good visibility, a fact the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) challenged in its preliminary report, saying there was patchy visibility. The judge said the facts suggested the Solong was not aware of another ship ahead. Motin, they said, had not acted properly and in a timely manner to avoid hitting the tanker. The police investigator said they believed Motin had failed his duty as captain to protect the ships and their crew. Further, they said he had shown no remorse at any stage and asserted that he changed his account of the events. The judge called the captain’s attitude “somewhat combative” and “argumentative,” saying he was trying to argue his way out of the clear-cut case.

Subscribe Now The defense had admitted Motin’s mistake but argued that it did not meet the standard of gross negligence. They said he had become confused when the ship did not respond to his change of course. Motin said he now realizes he pressed the wrong button and failed to turn off the autopilot. Prosecutors argued that it should have been immediately obvious, especially to Motin, who had commanded the ship for years. The defense cited his previous record and called the events of that morning an “aberration of his conduct.” Motin had told the court he realized his career at sea was over. He said he never intended to return to sea.",

      "text": "Chinese Nationals Paid to Marry US Navy Personnel - And Get Base Access U.S. military Common Access Cards (DOD file image) Published Feb 5, 2026 5:00 PM by The Maritime Executive Four U.S. Navy sailors have pleaded guilty to charges of bribery for taking money from Chinese nationals for sham marriage arrangements. These fake marriages were set up so that the perpetrators could secure U.S. permanent residency and evade American immigration enforcement. In addition, some of the co-defendants in the scheme made attempts to secure military ID cards that would allow them access to U.S. military bases. The Justice Department charged 11 civilians with marriage fraud conspiracy. Four former Navy servicemembers - Raymond Zumba, Brinio Urena, Morgan Chambers, and Jacinth Bailey - were charged with related offenses. All four have pleaded guilty, the DOJ said. The DOJ alleged that the 11 people set up fake marriages for Chinese nationals in order to get permanent residency status for them. The scheme included detailed efforts to present the marriages as real, including photos of the \"couples\" intended to give the impression that they were in real relationships. These relationships did not exist; instead, U.S. citizens - particularly U.S. servicemembers - were recruited for these arrangements, and offered substantial cash payments in exchange, plus travel expenses. The payouts happened in three steps: the first for marriage, the second for successfully securing residency status, and the third for completing the transaction through divorce. In the case of Brinio Urena, the suspects offered $10,000 in advance, $20,000 after issuance of a green card, and $5,000 after a divorce - $35,000 in total. Urena confirmed in a guilty plea that he agreed to this arrangement. After Urena's \"wedding,\" per a separate indictment, co-conspirator Raymond Zumba asked Urena to help secure an ID card for a Chinese national to facilitate the \"immigration process.\" He also asked Urena for help in finding more Navy personnel to join in the scheme, and together they co-recruited at least one additional U.S. Navy servicemember. The Justice Department collected evidence through the use of confidential sources, who were approached by the co-conspirators behind the scheme and were offered similar sham marriage payments at the same going rate. Another servicemember implicated in the case, Jacinth Bailey, was promised a higher rate of $45,000 to marry a male Chinese national for immigration purposes, followed by divorce. She agreed, and traveled to Connecticut for the purpose of the marriage ceremony; the first time she met the future \"husband\"was on the day of the wedding, and she received $10,000 in cash later in the day. On the same day, a co-conspirator - through an interpreter - asked Bailey to apply for and obtain a military ID card that would allow for base access. Consistent with Urena's case, the request for a military ID was presented to Bailey late in the process, after an agreement had been arranged and the marriage was in motion or completed. Fake IDs Zumba took the military-ID component of the case all the way through the process of application, and came close to producing the desired result for the Chinese co-conspirators. According to an FBI agent who investigated the case, Zumba attempted to recruit a confidential government source for securing Common Access Cards (CAC cards) for his \"in-laws.\" The source had served with Zumba aboard a U.S. Navy warship, and the source's spouse worked in the card-issuance office at Naval Air Station Jacksonville. The source recorded parts of the conversation with Zumba, who offered a payment of $1,500 per card for his \"wife's parents.\" He said that they were from China, and upped the offer to $2,000 per card. In a later phone conversation, Zumba confirmed that at least one card would need to be enabled for base access so that the \"parents\" could go shopping on base; he acknowleged that there might be the possibility of buying more cards for other people if the deal worked out. CS-1 raised the price for the base-access card to $2,500 because of the added risk, and struck a \"deal\" - with the FBI's knowledge. On the same call, Zumba also disclosed his sham marriage details, including the payment he had received.

While Iran has taken similar actions in the past as part of a crackdown on smuggling, today’s seizures drew additional international attention due to the regional tensions. Iranian media reports indicate two unnamed vessels were stopped, both near Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. They are saying that more than one million liters of smuggled fuel, mostly diesel, was conficated and a total of 15 foreign crewmembers were detained and handed over to judicial authorities. The IRGC said it had been conducting intelligence monitoring and surveillance. It alleges the vessels had been operating as part of a coordinated smuggling network. TankerTrackers.com sought to put the reporting in context by highlighting that one million liters is approximately 6,289 barrels or just 745 tons. Martin Kelly, Head of Advisory at EOS Risk Group, also pointed out that today’s seizures were not an escalation amid the recent increased tensions. “However, the timing may/may not be a coincidental reminder that Iran can, and does seize ships in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz almost uncontested,” writes Kelly. Today’s seizures came as Iran was also highlighting that its foreign minister was departing for Oman and the nuclear talks with the United States scheduled for Friday. Earlier in the week, Iranian forces approached the U.S.-flagged tanker Stena Imperative. The same day, the U.S. shot down an Iranian drone that they said was menacing the USS Abraham Lincoln. The previous reports of seizures of smuggled fuel came in December, when Iran highlighted stopping three vessels. One of the ships, Valiant Roar , seized on December 8 with 6,000 tons of fuel, caused tensions with India after 16 crewmembers, Indian citizens, were detained. The Indian embassy asserted that it was being denied access and attempts to provide consular services to the detained crewmembers. The families made personal appeals to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India asserted that the vessel was stopped in international waters near the UAE port of Dibba. India’s External Affairs Ministry reported today, February 5, that eight of the crewmembers were being released and that it had been able to speak with and provide consular services to all the crewmembers. It said 10 had been placed in a jail in Bandar Abbas, while six remained on the vessel despite poor conditions. Five were released on February 2 and three more on February 3, with arrangements in process to bring them back to India. It said it was working to support the crewmembers still in detention.

      "text": "Future Prospects for the Port of Churchill on Canada’s Hudson Bay Courtesy Port of Churchill Published Feb 5, 2026 3:54 PM by Harry Valentine Discussions are underway in Canada in regard to the future development of the Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay. During the early to mid-1900s and prior to the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, Churchill was Canada’s main port for exporting Western Canadian agricultural produce to England and Europe, and could play a major role again if revived. Introduction The Port of Churchill is located in the northeastern region of the Canadian province of Manitoba, where the premier (equivalent to a state governor) is seeking assistance from Canada’s Federal Government to develop the port for future exports of oil and agricultural bulk freight. Several years ago, there was opposition from environmentalists in Quebec to plans to develop a pipeline intended to carry oil and natural gas from Western Canada to eastern Canada’s Atlantic provinces. There was a need across Eastern Canada for competitively priced oil and natural gas from Western Canada. As a result of opposition to build a pipeline across Quebec to Eastern Canada, Western Canada’s oil producing region chose to seek alternative methods to export oil and natural gas to European markets. There is potential in Saskatchewan to connect an oil pipeline from Western Canada to the railway line that connects to the Port of Churchill. There is scope at that port to deepen the draft of the maritime terminal and navigation that connects to it, to accept deeper draft bulk carriers. There is also a plan to develop an offshore terminal in deeper water in Hudson Bay, close to Churchill. Historical Factors Dating back into the early 1800s, there was minimal east – west transportation across Canada. The colonial government in England responded by providing funding to build a navigation canal along the north side of the St. Lawrence River, upstream of Montreal. After completion during mid 1840s, small vessels began to sail between the Port of Montreal and Lake Ontario. Subsequent construction of navigation locks between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, allowed ocean-going vessels of that period to sail between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. Per nautical mile, maritime transportation incurred lower transportation cost per ton (and per cubic foot of volume) when compared with railway transportation. While the inland waterway restricted the size of ocean vessels able to sail to/from Lake Superior, larger vessels of the late 19th and early 20th century could sail to the Port of Churchill. The cost of railway transportation to Port of Churchill from western Canadian wheat farms was far less than railway transportation to the Port of Montreal. As a result, the Port of Churchill proved to be practical and viable. St. Lawrence Seaway The construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway during the early 1950s and its opening during late 1950s allowed ocean size ships of that era passage between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Superior. As a result, the shorter railway distance between Western Canadian wheat farms and the Port of Thunder Bay reduced transportation cost compared to the Port of Churchill. As a result, grain storage silos were built at Thunder Bay, reducing the competitiveness of the Port of Churchill. Over time, more exports moved through the Port of Thunder Bay as operations at the Port of Churchill declined. Ship Development Over the first five years following the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the physical size of ocean-going freight ships remained essentially unchanged. By the mid-1960s, Japanese shipbuilders unveiled mega-scale bulk carriers of oil, for which there was a ready market. Over time, the physical size of carriers of dry bulk and oil increased to dimensions that exceeded the size of navigation locks along the St. Lawrence Seaway. At some locations, the sheer size of ultra-large bulk carriers required the construction of offshore terminals connected to land via undersea pipelines, to carry oil or liquefied natural gas. There is scope to deepen the draft of the terminal at Port of Churchill, along with the navigation passage to/from Hudson Bay. Breakwaters would redirect river current to prevent deposits of silt at either the terminal or in navigation channel. There may be scope to develop an offshore terminal near the Port of Churchill, with a short distance of undersea pipeline to carry oil and/or natural gas. A precedent from Great Lakes shipping involves a small vessel sailing ahead of a large vessel to break up winter ice cover, making year-round sailing possible across Hudson Bay. Future Prospects There is scope to develop the Port of Churchill to serve mega-size ships that carry the combined bulk freight tonnage of a fleet of Seaway-max ships. From a common junction in Saskatchewan, the railway line to Thunder Bay is marginally shorter than the railway distance to Churchill. A",

The Baltic Spirit (16,580 dwt) had stopped in the Gulf of Riga for bunkering on February 3 when the commando unit boarded the ship from a helicopter. They reported that the 23 crewmembers, all Russian nationals, cooperated as the ship was detained for a search. Registered in the Bahamas, the ship, which has a capacity of 5,700 pallets plus 268 refrigerated containers, was coming from Puerto Bolivar, Ecuador, and bound for Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Estonian Tax and Customs Bureau says it received information from international partners that there could be contraband aboard the ship. It decided to act while the ship was bunkering, reporting that a joint operation involving the police and border guard, navy, and the Transport Board was organized with the Tax and Customs Board. The ship was initially searched while still at anchor and then, on Wednesday, February 4, was directed to the port of Muuga. During the evening, the Tax and Customs Board reports that suspicious containers were removed from the ship for a customs inspection. \"This time, the information received from international partners was not confirmed,\" said Vitali Zajarin, head of the narcotics department of the Tax and Customs Board’s investigative department. The ship was released and departed Muuga at around 0215 Thursday morning, according to local media reports. The officials emphasized that criminals are increasingly using the maritime trade to transport smuggled goods, and the authorities are in close cooperation with international partners. They highlighted that the largest drug smuggling discovery to date came in the spring of 2022 in a similar situation. Dutch police and Finnish customs had supplied the information, and the search found 3.5 tons of cocaine hidden in banana crates aboard another ship coming from Ecuador.

      "text": "Photos: Future Carrier USS John F. Kennedy Completes Builder's Trials USS John F. Kennedy out on sea trials (HII) Published Feb 4, 2026 11:17 PM by The Maritime Executive The future USS John F. Kennedy, the second Ford-class carrier for the U.S. Navy, has completed builder's sea trials at Huntington Ingalls Newport News. It has been 17 years since the initial contract award for Kennedy , and more than 10 years since her keel-laying. The test run was the ship's first outing, and it is a milestone towards the high-tech carrier's long-awaited completion. Kennedy was affected by the same technological issues facing the first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford, which faced years of delays in bringing its weapons elevators and its launch & recovery deck gear up to standards. The electromagnetic technology behind these devices had never been to sea before, and Ford delivered without any working weapons elevators. To make the time required for repairs, her first major deployment was deferred until mid-2023, six years after commissioning. Kennedy also encountered issues with electromagnetic systems, causing delays to the second hull in the series. The Navy also added in additional scope of work pre-delivery to integrate the F-35C fighter into Kennedy's air wing. Certain capabilities are needed aboard to support the stealth fighter jet, and Kennedy will be the first in the class to have them. The builder's trials started in late January and have now concluded successfully, HII said in a statement. Shipbuilding personnel from HII Newport News were on board, along with Kennedy's crew and other Navy personnel.

Subscribe Now Kennedy is currently on track to deliver by early 2027, nearly two years later than planned. As first-in-class USS Nimitz is set to retire in May 2026, there will be a brief unplanned gap, and the U.S. Navy's carrier fleet will drop to 10 ships instead of 11 until Kennedy is online. By law, the Navy is required to maintain at least 11 carriers in operational condition. “Taking Kennedy to sea is a testament to the grit and determination of the world’s finest shipbuilders,” said Derek Murphy, NNS vice president of new construction aircraft carrier programs. “Our nation is depending on us to deliver these critical assets that will protect freedom around the world and we’re proud to see CVN 79 take another step toward joining the fleet.”",

      "text": "Posidonia to Break All Records as Duration of Shipping Gathering Extends Posidonia to include exhibition, conferences, networking, social and sporting events over 3 week period to welcome thousands of exhibitors and visitors from some 140 countries Published Feb 4, 2026 11:00 PM by The Maritime Executive [By: Posidonia 2026] The world’s most prestigious shipping exhibition is now also set to become the longest in duration shipping event, as Posidonia 2026 prepares to engage the global maritime community over a three-week period filled with conferences, networking, social and sporting events. Activities will begin in early-May and culminate during Posidonia Week, which officially takes place from 1–5 June. With 50,000 square metres of exhibition space at the Metropolitan Expo sold out months in advance, thousands of exhibitors and visitors from 140 countries will once again converge on Athens. Posidonia 2026 is eagerly anticipated across a broad spectrum of the local economy, including hotels, catering and restaurants, transport and mobility providers, entertainment and sporting venues and stand builders, amongst others. The event is expected to contribute over €100m to the economy of Attica and neighbouring tourism destinations. Theodore Vokos, Managing Director of Posidonia Exhibitions S.A., said: “The economic and business impact of Posidonia now begins nearly three weeks before the official opening, as conferences, business meetings, industry gatherings and sporting events are increasingly scheduled ahead of the traditionally crowded Posidonia Week. With many events staged during the preceding 15-day period, the overall Posidonia timeframe has expanded significantly. This extended activity cycle is expected to deliver even greater benefits to the local economy, with hotel and event-space bookings already exceeding 2024 levels.” He added: “Posidonia is returning with greater strength and scale than ever before, driven by the industry’s renewed momentum and a shared commitment to maintaining the exhibition’s status as an unmissable biennial meeting point for the global maritime community — a place to connect, exchange ideas and collaborate now and into the future. No other shipping event attracts as many Shipping Ministers, presidents of international organisations, Greek and international shipowners and senior shipping executives.” As the home show of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS) - the world’s largest and most influential shipowners’ association - Posidonia has long served as a magnet for not only for shipyards and maritime equipment and service providers, but also for the finance, insurance and technology sectors, reflecting the UGS’s collective strength and expanding orderbook. In 2025, Greek shipowners placed 250 newbuilding orders. Greek shipowners also rank second worldwide in second-hand vessel acquisitions, with around 260 purchases concluding last year, surpassed only by China. Germany and Italy will return with National Pavilions after prolonged absence, with their ship equipment manufacturers and services providers showcasing their offering. To accommodate strong demand, the organisers utilized all available space to welcome some 40 new and returning exhibitors, including start- ups, technology innovators and shipyards from the Far East and Australia. With shipping facing plenty of headwinds at the moment in a challenging international environment, a lot is to be debated at Posidonia. According to the head of research and valuations of Cass Technava, Eva Tzima: “Topics to be discussed will include geopolitics, environmental regulatory requirements, and of course technological advancements and the possible benefits the use of AI could offer to shipping. It goes without saying that while all these areas are of high interest to the industry, geopolitical developments are expected to dominate discussions, not only because they continue to shape market supply and demand dynamics, but also because their impact has been extending across other areas of interest, as evidenced by the delay in IMO’s net zero framework adoption voted last year, following intensive lobbying from the U.S. administration.” The Posidonia 2026 Conference Programme is already taking shape. The Marine Insurance Greece and RightShip conferences will open proceedings in early May with a focus on risk management and maritime risk and security. The TradeWinds Shipowners Forum 2026 will take place on the first day of the exhibition, bringing together leading shipowners to debate the industry’s most pressing challenges, followed by the HELMEPA Conference, which will address environmental and sustainability issues. Among the highlights will be the SNAME Conference, titled “The Greek Shipyard Renaissance: Rebuilding Capacity, Restoring Leadership”, which will explore the future of Greece’s resurgent shipyard sector. The Posidonia Games continue to expand into a major sporting and social platform and create their own maritime ecosys",

      "text": "Hempel Completes First Round of Successful Applications with Hempaguard NB Tangier Maersk Published Feb 4, 2026 10:32 PM by The Maritime Executive [By: Hempel] Hempel has successfully completed the first ever applications of its next-generation silicone hull coating, Hempaguard NB, with one of the newbuilding vessels being Tangier Maersk - the first in a new series of six 9,000 TEU vessels ordered by Maersk. This marks an important step in extending the proven Hempaguard performance to vessels directly out of the newbuilding yard. Applied at Yangzijiang Shipyard (YZJ) in China in October 2025, this successful result was achieved through close collaboration between YZJ, Maersk and Hempel. Even though it was the first application of Hempaguard NB, the work was carried out efficiently and without impacting the vessel’s launch schedule, underscoring the coating’s suitability for streamlined newbuilding operations. “This milestone shows how effectively Hempaguard NB can be applied during vessel construction when shipyards, owners and Hempel’s coating and application specialists work closely together,” says Alexander Enström, Head of New Build at Hempel. “It provides a practical pathway for introducing silicone coatings in newbuilding without schedule impact.” The successful application is viewed as a significant achievement for Hempel, Maersk and YZJ. Building on the strong results achieved during the project, additional vessels under the same contract are scheduled to be coated with Hempaguard NB during 2026. Ole Graa Jakobsen, Head of Fleet Technology at Maersk says: “As fuel efficiency remains one of our top priorities, we are continuously refining coating solutions on our vessels to ensure optimal hydrodynamic performance. The successful application during the newbuilding process marks a significant milestone, and we see this as a step towards more efficient newbuilding workflows going forward. The strong collaboration between YZJ, Hempel and Maersk has been key in ensuring a smooth and successful application.” Jie HONG, Director of QA&QC Department at Yangzijiang Shipyard, adds that: “Our collaboration with Hempel and Maersk on this project has clearly demonstrated that advanced silicone coatings can be applied during the newbuilding process without causing disruption or delays. This not only reinforces our confidence in adopting innovative technologies, but also provides our yard with a valuable competitive edge as we continue to pursue higher efficiency and performance in future projects.” The results on Tangier Maersk reinforce Hempel’s dedication to developing new coating solutions in close collaboration with partners across the maritime industry, who are reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

Published Feb. 5, 2026 Phil Neuffer Senior Editor Share Copy link Email LinkedIn X/Twitter Facebook Print License Add us on Google European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen speaks at the European Commission headquarters on Jan. 22, 2026, in Brussels, Belgium. Beyond resuming work on a tariff pact with the U.S., the EU on Wednesday also agreed to extend by another six months a suspension of retaliatory measures to U.S. tariffs enacted last year. Omar Havana via Getty Images Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . The European Union will resume work to implement a framework trade agreement with the United States after halting efforts in response to tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump floated potential levies on eight European countries as part of his push to wrest control of Greenland, leading European Parliament members to vote to indefinitely suspend a pact reached with the U.S. in August in Turnberry, Scotland. Although Trump later walked back the threat, the European legislative body maintained the freeze until Wednesday, when its International Trade Committee agreed to reopen deal implementation efforts, according to a press release. As of now, the committee is focused on two specific proposals within the larger framework agreement, namely the removal of tariffs on U.S.-based industrial products and certain seafood and agricultural products, including lobster. “Trade Committee members remain committed to advancing work on the two legislative proposals expeditiously, provided the US respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Union and its member states, and honours the terms of the Turnberry Deal,” Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee, said in the release. Lange said the committee could vote on the proposals as soon as Feb. 24. He added that as the committee evaluates the proposals, it will also expand rules governing the EU’s ability to suspend the deal, particularly to address “threats to the essential security interests of the Union or its member states, including their territorial integrity.” As the European Parliament continues to work through the proposals, the European Commission said Wednesday it would further suspend retaliatory duties on U.S. goods it first introduced last year prior to the Turnberry deal. Wednesday’s decision extends the suspension for another six months to Aug. 6 as the U.S. and EU continue efforts to implement provisions of the agreement. The retaliatory measures were announced in response to the Trump administration’s implementation of new levies, including those on steel and automobiles . The commission in August suspended the countermeasures for six months as the two trading partners moved forward with the framework pact. Although the Trump administration has secured similar framework deals with numerous trading partners, the dustup with the EU shows how fragile these alliances can be. Beyond threatening tariffs as a means of advancing his Greenland campaign, Trump also recently said he would hike levies to 25% on imports from South Korea, saying the country has not met the terms of a pact reached with the U.S. last year. The U.S. has yet to publish official documentation of any potential tariff hikes, but earlier this week, South Korea Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources Jung-Kwan Kim met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to discuss the impasse. “While the talks provided an opportunity to deepen mutual understanding of the U.S. intent behind the planned tariff increase and find middle ground, additional discussions with the U.S. side are still needed,” Kim said in a statement , adding that “the government will fully implement the Korea–U.S. tariff agreement to minimize trade uncertainties for Korean companies operating in the U.S. market.” Editor’s note: This story was first published in our Procurement Weekly newsletter.

First published on Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Eli Lilly will invest more than $3.5 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, designed to make injectable weight-loss drugs and medical devices, the company said Friday. This is the fourth U.S. manufacturing site that Lilly has announced since last February. The project will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, according to a news release. The site is expected to be operational in 2031. Lilly has received $100 million in support from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development for the project. It's the largest investment by a life sciences company in the state to date, officials said. Construction will begin this year. Dive Insight: Lilly purchased a site in Fogelsville, an unincorporated town, to build its first facility in Pennsylvania. The project has received $50 million in state tax credits and $50 million in expansion and job creation grants. In relation to the project, the state is also providing up to $5 million to a local community college or technical school to offer workforce development services for the company. Pennsylvania accelerated the project as part of its PA Permit Fast Track Program , signed into effect November 2024. Once completed, the manufacturing site will produce injectable weight-loss drugs, including retatrutide, as well as injection devices, according to the release. Retatrutide, a triple-hormone receptor agonist designed to treat obesity and type-2 diabetes, cleared late-stage trial results in December. Lilly said participants who stayed on the drug for 68 weeks lost on average 28.7% of their body weight and saw improvements in knee pain. More trials are expected this year as retatrutide awaits regulatory approval. “To meet increasing demand, we’re expanding our U.S. manufacturing network, with Lehigh Valley adding capacity for next-generation weight-loss medicines,” David Ricks, Lilly chair and CEO, said in a statement. “ We’re creating high-quality jobs and collaborating across the region — with suppliers, educators, and workforce-development partners — to make critical medicines in the U.S.” Lilly has dedicated billions of dollars in recent months to its U.S. manufacturing expansion. In September, the company pledged $5 billion to construct a factory outside of Richmond, Virginia, for cancer and autoimmune treatments. In addition, it pledged $6.5 billion to build a Houston facility that will make its first obesity pill, among other medicines. In December, Lilly also committed more than $6 billion to build a site in Huntsville, Alabama , for oral weight-loss treatments. The company said these new plants, including the Lehigh Valley site, will leverage advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, integrated monitoring and data analytics to make operations more efficient and reliable. The investments are part of a broader initiative by Lilly to invest more than $50 billion to construct and refurbish its U.S. factories as President Donald Trump pressures companies to bring operations stateside through tariffs, tax incentives and other means. In February 2025, when Lilly announced its expansion initiative, it was considered to be the largest commitment to domestic manufacturing by a pharmaceutical company in the past decade. Since then, other pharmaceutical giants such as Roche , AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have followed suit, making their own similar multibillion-dollar commitments to manufacturing, technology and research and development.

Dive Brief: Walmart is investing more than $330 million to modernize its regional distribution center in Opelousas, Louisiana , according to a Jan. 15 press release from Louisiana Economic Development. The retailer intends to equip the distribution center with robotics and automation, which will double the facility’s shipping capacity once complete, per the press release. The multiyear project is set to begin this year and will occur in phases, per the press release. Dive Insight: The modernization project is part of Walmart’s push to upgrade all 42 of its regional distribution centers, according to the press release. Walmart aims to retain its workforce and transition roles toward higher-skilled positions in automation, advanced technology and robotics, according to the press release. Currently, the retailer has more than 37,400 employees in Louisiana, more than 1,900 of whom work in its distribution centers. “This will play a strategic role in supporting our goal of modernizing our vast supply chain network by increasing the speed, efficiency, and safety at which products are distributed across our regional distribution centers,” a spokesperson told Supply Chain Dive in an email. As of November 2025, more than 60% of Walmart’s U.S. stores received some freight from automated distribution centers , which has lowered shipping costs. The retailer has also been pushing automation elsewhere in its supply chain, including its “next generation” fulfillment centers, where products are shipped to customers. Walmart has outlined several ways it leverages automation throughout its supply chain over the last few years. For instance, Walmart implemented autonomous forklifts from Fox Robotics and Wiliot inventory-tracking sensors .

Published Feb. 5, 2026 Kelly Stroh Editor Share Copy link Email LinkedIn X/Twitter Facebook Print License Add us on Google Panelists discuss how the end of the de minimis exemption impacted the holiday shipping season during a Jan. 28 event hosted by Supply Chain Dive and Retail Dive. Kelly Stroh/Supply Chain Dive Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Editor’s note: This story is part of a series highlighting takeaways from a Jan. 28 event hosted by Supply Chain Dive and Retail Dive. Register here to watch the replay on demand . Companies that previously relied on the de minimis exemption for cross-border shipments must be even more vigilant about data precision and margin protection following the trade tool’s demise, experts said during Supply Chain Dive’s Jan. 28 event, “How the 2025 Holiday Season Fared & What It Says About 2026.” The de minimis provision — a federal regulation that previously exempted imports below $800 to enter the U.S. tax and tariff free — was abruptly eliminated in August 2025 . Before its demise, the exemption was a key driver in direct-to-consumer e-commerce imports , fueling nearly 1.4 billion import shipments in 2024, with the total value of eligible goods reaching $64.6 billion , according to data from Customs and Border Protection . The end of the trade tool has had ripple effects throughout the supply chain, impacting air cargo volumes and capacity , peak season planning and profit margins for retailers such as Aritzia . Here are four best practices panel experts suggested merchants and e-commerce retailers employ to successfully navigate the post-de minimis environment. 1. Gather your data While the provision enabled low-cost imports to avoid duties, it also meant that goods could come into the country without item-related data, Maia Benson, chief business officer at FlavorCloud , said. This is not the case anymore. “Get your data in line,” Benson said. For shippers importing in the U.S., this includes 10-digit HS codes, country of origin and “excellent product descriptions.” “So data, data, data is going to be required of all inbound shippers, small, medium and large,” Benson said. 2. Protect your margins “The best guidance I can give is [to] protect your margins,” Benson said. To do this, she suggested first knowing your margins and then using information that allows shippers to construct pricing strategies based on landed cost data. Working with supply chain and logistics partners to bring in inventory, offer storage options and build business cases to justify rightsizing a U.S. footprint for inventory health is also key, according to Benson. 3. Secure a good customs partner Companies inbounding goods should identify and engage with a trusted customs partner, Darby Meegan , general manager of omnichannel at Flexport , said. This is especially important for brands that are entering the U.S. market through a standard customs flow for the first time. Beyond the demise of de minimis, tariffs have also changed throughout the last year as President Donald Trump reshapes U.S. trade policy. Such duties can be line items based on composition, assembly or country of origin, Meegan said. Strong customer partners can work with brands to analyze products and ensure “that you're getting the most out of your inbounding , and you're paying what you owe, and not more.” Further, brands may review SKU rationalization and target a smaller SKU profile, focusing on a core catalog to help control product costs, Meegan said. “If you're not already doing it, start doing it and look at it very intently,” he said. 4. Negotiate for optimal rates Brands should negotiate with partners and providers to procure the best shipping rates, Meegan advised. He further noted companies should examine the cost of their supply chains to identify places where they can “squeeze it,” especially as tariffs threaten to drive up operating costs. “But if you're densifying your supply chain, if you're working with good partners, and you are accelerating the intelligence behind your supply chain, you're going to see huge dividends,” he said. Meegan added that problems will continue to evolve, and issues in Q1 are not going to be the same challenges faced in Q3. While inventory and carrying costs will become an issue right now, companies must focus on how they procure goods and import them to the U.S. “But, ultimately, the dedication and the intensity of which you approach these problems are going to pay dividends,” Meegan said.

The retailer is looking to deliver more orders of large items, like fence panels, with its own network. Courtesy of Tractor Supply Listen to the article 2 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Tractor Supply Co. is prioritizing lower costs and improved efficiency for shipments of online orders this year, an effort driven by its ongoing final-mile delivery initiative, President and CEO Hal Lawton said on a Q4 earnings call last week. As part of the initiative, the retailer plans on adding in 2026 more than 150 new hub locations, which bring drivers and inventory from different facilities together for deliveries to nearby customers. That will result in Tractor Supply having about 375 hubs covering over half its stores. \"One way to think about that level of coverage is that it gives us last-mile delivery capabilities across more than 1,200 stores and reaching over 15 million customers,\" Lawton said. Dive Insight: Tractor Supply unveiled its final-mile initiative in December 2024 as part of a push to make more customer deliveries in-house, particularly for big and bulky shipments like fence panels and riding lawnmowers. By the end of the decade, the company plans to deliver up to 95% of large-item orders itself, EVP and Chief Supply Chain Officer Colin Yankee said when the program was first announced. The company tends to see higher customer satisfaction scores with in-house deliveries, he added. While Tractor Supply is looking to lean more on its own delivery network, it's also integrating more deeply with gig providers like UPS' Roadie to lower cost per delivery across channels, according to Lawton. He identified \"$10-ish million a year\" in freight-related savings tied to the final-mile plan, which will both help the company's gross margins and cover continued investments in the initiative. \"So that initiative in many ways is kind of self-funding itself as it goes,\" Lawton said. The final-mile push comes as Tractor Supply saw Q4 gross margin decline about 10 basis points year over year due in part to higher delivery-related transportation costs. The company also fell short of its expectations in the quarter as weaker demand for discretionary goods and fewer severe weather events, which typically lead to sales boosts for emergency purchases, weighed on sales.

All varieties of fresh tomatoes are included on the FDA's Food Traceability List. Getty Images First published on Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . The grocery industry is the driving force behind food traceability — even though retailers and suppliers have more than a year longer than expected to meet a key federal compliance deadline. Originally set for Jan, 20, 2026, the compliance deadline for section 204 of the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was extended by 30 months to July 20, 2028. Under FSMA 204, businesses must be able to quickly provide detailed records for specific high-risk foods on the Food Traceability List to help trace contamination. While the grocery industry hasn’t been shy about calling for regulatory changes to make food traceability requirements less burdensome, it is also making progress in pushing suppliers to get compliance-ready. During a webinar in late 2025 hosted by Repositrak, which provides a food traceability platform for retailers, wholesalers and suppliers, the company said that more than 70 retailers, wholesalers and foodservice companies, including Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons, have already established their own traceability requirements — many of which are more extensive than the federal requirements. “Many [companies] have more data requirements for more foods with faster deadlines than the FDA, and that’s why we say it’s not the FDA deadline that matters,” Mark Johnson, a then-partner at Repositrak and former merchandising leader at C&S Wholesale Grocers and United Natural Foods, Inc., said during the webinar. Albertsons, Sam’s Club, KeHE, Kroger, Walmart and Target are among the companies requiring traceability for all foods — not just the ones on the FDA’s Food Traceability List, Repositrak shared during the webinar. For food retailers, requiring suppliers to meet traceability requirements for all foods makes data collection easy and consistent, according to Repositrak, noting that the FSMA 204 requirements have become a “baseline” to which most retailers and wholesalers are adding unique traceability requirements. “We’ve discovered that nearly half of the 70-plus retailers and wholesalers who have announced traceability programs are asking all food suppliers for traceability data,” Brian Shanahan, a partner at Repositrak, said on the webinar. Some grocers, such as Aldi, H-E-B, Meijer, Publix and Wegmans, have deadlines that are sooner than the FDA’s, Repositrak noted. Meanwhile, suppliers have different levels of technical capabilities, which can be a hurdle for food traceability efforts, Shanahan, who was a category manager for Stop & Shop and Rite Aid before joining Repositrak, said. Some suppliers haven’t started working on traceability requirements because of the delayed federal compliance deadline or because their food products aren’t on the Food Traceability List. Repositrak is urging suppliers to get started on this work sooner rather than later. “It can take months for a supplier to complete all of the steps to begin to share traceability consistently and accurately,” Shanahan said on the webinar. Repositrak has been working through traceability requirements with suppliers over the past several months. Last month, the company unveiled an expanded partnership with the National Grocers Association for traceability compliance management that will include jointly rolling out new education, training and resources geared toward independent grocers.

The Postal Service is soliciting bids for businesses to directly access its last-mile facilities as it seeks to boost revenue. Brett Carlsen via Getty Images Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . The U.S. Postal Service's last-mile facilities are open for business — at the right price. The agency is enabling shippers to reserve capacity at thousands of locations nationwide via an online bidding process, part of Postmaster General and CEO David Steiner's efforts to better monetize the USPS network . Winning bidders will be able to inject volume into facilities closer to end customers for faster delivery, bypassing the standard end-to-end Postal Service shipping process. “We see this initiative as a compelling value proposition for many shippers who we know are wrestling with the need to deliver to their customer as quickly and reliably as possible,\" Steiner said in a December news release . \"Our solution is to establish a fair bidding process that enables the marketplace to find the best mix of local shipping attributes for the best volume-driven pricing.\" Steve Monteith, the Postal Service's chief customer and marketing officer, provided answers to three key questions about the process during an agency webinar on Monday, including what can be bid on, how to bid and what comes after. What can shippers bid on? Shippers can bid on capacity at the Postal Service's more than 18,000 destination delivery units, or DDUs, near end consumers and 170-plus local processing centers further upstream, Monteith said. Interested parties can also make a wider-ranging bid for local markets or entire regions covered by these facilities based on business needs. Terms for winning bidders will be solidified through a negotiated service agreement for the Postal Service's Parcel Select product. Successful bidders can then bring volume directly to destination delivery units and local processing centers for expected same-day or next-day delivery. The entry points will accept volume from multiple container types, including bags, pallets and gaylords, Monteith said. Such an approach has historically been used among package consolidators and other large-scale shippers before the USPS disincentivized direct DDU access under former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. Now headed by Steiner, the Postal Service wants a wider range of customers to tap into its last-mile capacity in a bid to increase revenue. \"Direct DDU access gives shippers the ability to inject parcels deeper into the USPS network, bypass upstream chokepoints, and stabilize last‑mile performance,\" Derreck Travers, SmartKargo SVP of e-commerce and business development, said on LinkedIn . \"For high‑volume, lightweight residential shipments, this creates opportunities to simplify routing and reduce reliance on consolidators.\" How can shippers bid? Shippers can submit an inquiry form with their email address, company name and phone number via the Postal Service's website . The submission is directed to the USPS sales team, which will contact bidders about participating in the process and accessing the online portal in which bids are made. Once the agency grants access to the portal, shippers can upload a spreadsheet with their bid information. This can include volume commitments, number of parcels or pallets per period, pricing structure per parcel or pallet, package handoff timing, and tender and pickup windows, Monteith said. \"You decide how to structure your solution by proposing your own combination of volume-based pricing and tender times at your preferred location,\" Monteith said. \"The result is a logistics strategy that's fully customizable, flexible and built around your priorities.\" Many businesses will likely keep their bids focused on areas \"where it drives revenue lift, while avoiding lanes where bidding pushes USPS costs above their threshold,\" according to Travers. \"The bidding environment will reward networks that can offer consistent volume, predictable tender windows, and strong service performance,\" Travers said. What happens after bids are submitted? Bid submissions can be adjusted until the portal closes on Feb. 17. Once the bid process concludes, the Postal Service aims to lock in accepted offers through negotiated service agreements. The agency plans to notify winning bidders in the second quarter of 2026, with service launching as soon as the third quarter in the \"July, August timeframe,\" Monteith said.

The Trump administration's U.S. Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve would be an independently governed public-private partnership, the U.S. Export-Import Bank said. Getty Images Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a $12 billion critical mineral stockpile, a key step in the administration's efforts to reduce U.S. dependence on other countries for materials vital to the defense, energy, auto and technology industries. The president signed the order on Monday at a White House ceremony that included administration officials and industry leaders, including General Motors CEO Mary Barra. \"Today, we're launching what will be known as Project Vault to ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage,\" Trump said, comparing the initiative to the U.S. petroleum reserve created to protect the U.S. economy from severe disruptions in oil supplies. Funding for the U.S. Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve includes a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and $2 billion in private sector financing, Trump said. The president did not provide further details, and the executive order had not been published as of Tuesday afternoon. However, the Export-Import Bank issued a press release saying the reserve would be an independently governed public-private partnership. The bank is providing a long-term $10 billion direct loan to an alliance of original equipment manufacturers and private-sector capital providers in support of the reserve. The bank said there were \"initial indications of participation\" from OEMs, including Clarios, GE Vernova, Western Digital and Boeing. Suppliers that will service Project Vault included Hartree Partners, Mercuria Americas and Traxys, per the release. The critical mineral initiative advances Trump's economic and national security objectives by reducing dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains to avoid disruptions that would harm the domestic industrial base, the bank said. Before establishing the reserve, the Trump administration had been bolstering critical mineral suppliers through loans and funding. Late last month, the Commerce Department's CHIPS Program Office signed a non-binding letter of intent with USA Rare Earth covering up to $1.6 billion in proposed support. The LOI envisions $277 million in proposed federal funding and a $1.3 billion proposed senior secured loan to help USA Rare Earth accelerate development of its mining, processing and manufacturing operations. Other companies that have entered private deals with the Trump administration before the latest announcement included Vulcan Elements and MP Materials . Along with pursuing deals with private companies, Trump has also instructed cabinet officials to negotiate trade agreements on the import of critical minerals and their derivatives with trading partners following a Section 232 probe into the sector.

A Pearson report identified “a missing link” that prevents both employers and workers from fully realizing AI’s potential. Leon Neal via Getty Images First published on Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Augmenting jobs with artificial intelligence and upskilling employees, instead of replacing workers, could add between $4.8 trillion and $6.6 trillion to the U.S. economy by 2034, roughly 15% of current U.S. GDP at the lower range, according to new research released Jan. 19 from education company Pearson. However, the report found that while companies were “investing billions worldwide on AI infrastructure and models,” there were “few positive examples of enterprise-level productivity gains, outside of coding, that truly help workers and drive ROI,” per a news release, which added that the return on AI investment usually targets replacing workers. AI has reached more than one billion users in only three years, per the release. Yet the technology is taking “ a growing emotional and economic toll ” on workers, who fear losing their jobs and their competitive edge without training accompanying their adoption. Dive Insight: The report, which was released during the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting, said that employers “risk missing the productivity prize” by focusing on technology deployment while neglecting the human element. Citing data from the World Economic Forum, Pearson said in the release that 59% of the global workforce will need reskilling by 2030. While many employees reported time saved through AI, a broader economic uplift hasn’t yet occurred, per the release. Pearson’s report identified what it called a critical “learning gap,” and said there is “a missing link” that prevents both employers and workers from fully realizing AI’s potential. “AI will drive profound long-term change to business and industry,” Pearson CEO Omar Abbosh said in a news release. “But leaders are under pressure to rapidly adopt AI and demonstrate a return on that investment, all while bringing worried employees along with this seismic shift. Every positive scenario for this AI-enabled future is built on human development.” Abbosh added that the biggest obstacle to AI adoption is “the lack of human skills to work alongside these technologies,” and said addressing this issue could “support workers, boost their confidence with new technology, and drive the ROI outcomes that businesses want.” Meanwhile, an October report from Express Employment Professionals and Harris Poll found that although 72% of hiring managers said their companies are using AI , more than half also said their organizations don’t have the resources to train their employees how to use it effectively.

Dive Brief: UPS now offers RFID labels for packages dropped off at all 5,500 The UPS Store locations to boost shipment visibility and reduce defects, CEO Carol Tomé said in an earnings call last week. RFID labeling at the point of origin \"gives better transparency order-to-cash, something that customers are desperately seeking,\" Tomé said. UPS Store locations are currently processing 1.3 million packages with RFID labeling daily. The added capability will help UPS win more commercial business, according to Tomé. The company has also installed RFID tag readers in all its U.S. package cars, allowing the delivery vehicles to identify packages to increase efficiency. Dive Insight: UPS' RFID-centered moves, part of the carrier's ongoing \"Smart Package Smart Facility\" initiative, aim to advance two crucial goals for the parcel carrier amid its ongoing network overhaul. One is to increase UPS' appeal among shippers. Large enterprise retailers in the U.S. embrace the company's RFID offerings \"because they have inbound visibility to what's hitting their docks, and it allows them then to spread their workforce and how they inbound that volume,\" Matt Guffey, EVP and chief commercial and strategy officer, said during a January 2025 earnings call . The initiative is among several capabilities UPS has been investing in to attract more customers. Another example is the company's Digital Access Platform, which connects to e-commerce platforms to offer rate discounts and other shipper services. The platform has seen its revenue grow from $139 million when Tomé joined UPS in 2020 to $4.1 billion by the end of 2025. \"That platform is something that small- and medium-sized businesses enjoy using for delivery as they're selling through partners like eBay and Shopify and others,\" Tomé said on last week's call. \"So we're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow us to win new business.\" The RFID push also aims to boost the throughput of packages flowing through UPS' network while limiting labor-intensive tasks. UPS' installation of RFID sensors in its vehicles eliminated 12 million scans daily in 2024, when the company already equipped 66% of its package car fleet with the technology. Increasing automation is a priority for UPS as it sees reduced volume originating from major customer Amazon and transitions its U.S. operations to what Tomé called \"a smaller and nimbler network.\" UPS expects to increase U.S. volume processed through automated facilities from 66.5% in 2025 to 68% this year. \"We have 127 buildings that are automated,\" Tome said. \"We are adding another 24 in 2026. The cost per piece in these automated buildings is 28% less than the cost per piece in our conventional buildings. So automation is one way that we will continue to drive productivity.\" Recommended Reading UPS preps 30K job cuts, more driver buyouts in 2026 By Max Garland • Jan. 27, 2026 Add us on Google Share Copy link Email LinkedIn X/Twitter Facebook Print purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Last-Mile Delivery, Technology, Logistics",

      "title": "How recruitment fraud turned cloud IAM into a $2 billion attack surface",
      "text": "A developer gets a LinkedIn message from a recruiter. The role looks legitimate. The coding assessment requires installing a package. That package exfiltrates all cloud credentials from the developer’s machine — GitHub personal access tokens, AWS API keys, Azure service principals and more — are exfiltrated, and the adversary is inside the cloud environment within minutes. Your email security never saw it. Your dependency scanner might have flagged the package. Nobody was watching what happened next. The attack chain is quickly becoming known as the identity and access management (IAM) pivot, and it represents a fundamental gap in how enterprises monitor identity-based attacks. CrowdStrike Intelligence research published on January 29 documents how adversary groups operationalized this attack chain at an industrial scale. Threat actors are cloaking the delivery of trojanized Python and npm packages through recruitment fraud, then pivoting from stolen developer credentials to full cloud IAM compromise. In one late-2024 case, attackers delivered malicious Python packages to a European FinTech company through recruitment-themed lures, pivoted to cloud IAM configurations and diverted cryptocurrency to adversary-controlled wallets. Entry to exit never touched the corporate email gateway, and there is no digital evidence to go on. On a recent episode of CrowdStrike’s Adversary Universe podcast , Adam Meyers, the company's SVP of intelligence and head of counter adversary operations, described the scale: More than $2 billion associated with cryptocurrency operations run by one adversary unit. Decentralized currency, Meyers explained, is ideal because it allows attackers to avoid sanctions and detection simultaneously. CrowdStrike's field CTO of the Americas, Cristian Rodriguez, explained that revenue success has driven organizational specialization. What was once a single threat group has split into three distinct units targeting cryptocurrency, fintech and espionage objectives. That case wasn’t isolated. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) and security company JFrog have tracked overlapping campaigns across the npm ecosystem, with JFrog identifying 796 compromised packages in a self-replicating worm that spread through infected dependencies. The research further documents WhatsApp messaging as a primary initial compromise vector, with adversaries delivering malicious ZIP files containing trojanized applications through the platform. Corporate email security never intercepts this channel. Most security stacks are optimized for an entry point that these attackers abandoned entirely. When dependency scanning isn’t enough Adversaries are shifting entry vectors in real-time. Trojanized packages aren’t arriving through typosquatting as in the past — they’re hand-delivered via personal messaging channels and social platforms that corporate email gateways don’t touch. CrowdStrike documented adversaries tailoring employment-themed lures to specific industries and roles, and observed deployments of specialized malware at FinTech firms as recently as June 2025. CISA documented this at scale in September, issuing an advisory on a widespread npm supply chain compromise targeting GitHub personal access tokens and AWS, GCP and Azure API keys. Malicious code was scanned for credentials during package installation and exfiltrated to external domains. Dependency scanning catches the package. That’s the first control, and most organizations have it. Almost none have the second, which is runtime behavioral monitoring that detects credential exfiltration during the install process itself. “When you strip this attack down to its essentials, what stands out isn’t a breakthrough technique,” Shane Barney, CISO at Keeper Security, said in an analysis of a recent cloud attack chain . “It’s how little resistance the environment offered once the attacker obtained legitimate access.” Adversaries are getting better at creating lethal, unmonitored pivots Google Cloud’s Threat Horizons Report found that weak or absent credentials accounted for 47.1% of cloud incidents in the first half of 2025, with misconfigurations adding another 29.4%. Those numbers have held steady across consecutive reporting periods. This is a chronic condition, not an emerging threat. Attackers with valid credentials don’t need to exploit anything. They log in. Research published earlier this month demonstrated exactly how fast this pivot executes . Sysdig documented an attack chain where compromised credentials reached cloud administrator privileges in eight minutes, traversing 19 IAM roles before enumerating Amazon Bedrock AI models and disabling model invocation logging. Eight minutes. No malware. No exploit. Just a valid credential and the absence of IAM behavioral baselines. Ram Varadarajan, CEO at Acalvio , put it bluntly : Breach speed has shifted from days to minutes, and defending against this class of attack demands technology that can ",

Melgarejo-Meseguer, Elena Casiraghi, Giorgio Valentini, José-Luis Rojo-Álvarez\n\nCATEGORIES: cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.NI\n\nABSTRACT:\nThe rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.",

Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \\emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.",

In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.",

However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets. Despite its promise, offline FRL may break down under low-quality, heterogeneous data. Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $δ$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees. Extensive experiments show FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines under varying data quality and heterogeneity.",

In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \\emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.",

Despite its advantages, most existing FL-based IDS assume closed-set learning and lack mechanisms such as uncertainty estimation, semantic generalization, and explicit modeling of epistemic ambiguity in zero-day attack scenarios. Additionally, robustness to heterogeneous and unreliable clients remains a challenge in practical applications. This paper introduces a semantics-driven federated IDS framework that incorporates language-derived semantic supervision into federated optimization, enabling open-set and zero-shot intrusion detection for previously unseen attack behaviors. The approach constructs semantic attack prototypes using a Tri-LLM ensemble of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and LLaMA-3-8B, aligning distributed telemetry features with high-level attack concepts. Inter-LLM semantic disagreement is modeled as epistemic uncertainty for zero-day risk estimation, while a trust-aware aggregation mechanism dynamically weights client updates based on reliability. Experimental results show stable semantic alignment across heterogeneous clients and consistent convergence. The framework achieves over 80% zero-shot detection accuracy on unseen attack patterns, improving zero-day discrimination by more than 10% compared to similarity-based baselines, while maintaining low aggregation instability in the presence of unreliable or compromised clients.",

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.",

However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands.

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.",

As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.",

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed training framework for this purpuse. However, the data heterogeneity issue among IoT devices can significantly degrade the model performance and convergence speed in FL. Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA.

Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD.",

The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital \"immune system\" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.",

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.",

The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%.

The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments.",

MDG simulates realistic MLaaS behaviour by training and evaluating diverse model families across multiple real-world datasets and data distribution settings. It records detailed functional attributes, quality of service metrics, and composition-specific indicators, enabling systematic analysis of service performance and cross-service behaviour. Using MDG, we generate more than ten thousand MLaaS service instances and construct a large-scale benchmark dataset suitable for downstream evaluation. We also implement a built-in composition mechanism that models how services interact under varied Internet of Things conditions. Experiments demonstrate that datasets generated by MDG enhance selection accuracy and composition quality compared to existing baselines. MDG provides a practical and extensible foundation for advancing data-driven research on MLaaS selection and composition",

Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.",

In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency.

Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.",

Most current methods are \"coupled\" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.",

(6 authors)\n\nCATEGORIES: cs.LG, cs.AI\n\nABSTRACT:\nTelemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS.",

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework (DMEF) for high-accuracy plant disease diagnosis under resource constraints. DMEF employs an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically combines the predictions of three lightweight convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3) by optimizing a trade-off between accuracy improvements (DeltaAcc) and computational efficiency (model size). During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for potato and maize diseases demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 99.53% and 96.61%, respectively, surpassing standalone models and static ensembles by 2.1% and 6.3%. With computationally efficient inference latency (<75ms) and a compact footprint (<1 million parameters), DMEF shows strong potential for edge-based agricultural monitoring, suggesting viability for scalable crop disease management. This bridges the gap between high-accuracy AI and practical field applications.",

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs.",
